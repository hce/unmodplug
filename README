This is UnModPlug, an attempt to get Oliver Lapicque's libmodplug into
Unreal/DeusEx. To compile, you need VC++6, the deus ex public headers
and the libmodplug.dll. libmodplug.dll is needed because Oliver's code
doesn't compile nicely with VC++6, so libmodplug.dll was generated
with a newer version of VC. You also need SDL and SDL audio.
