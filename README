This is UnModPlug, an attempt to get Oliver Lapicque's libmodplug into
Unreal/DeusEx.

I've put this on github for informational purposes. If you want to use
it, contact me to get a compiled version, or simply download the
dxvetery mod, which includes it, and for which it was made for.

Still: To compile, you need VC++6, the deus ex public headers and the
libmodplug.dll. libmodplug.dll is needed because Oliver's code doesn't
compile nicely with VC++6, so libmodplug.dll was generated with a
newer version of VC.  You also need SDL and SDL audio.
